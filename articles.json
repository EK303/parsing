    "description": "In this tutorial, you'll learn how Python's del statement works and how to use it in your code. This statement will allow you to remove references from different scopes, items from lists, keys from dictionaries, and members from classes. This will lead to potentially memory-efficient code.",
    "text": "Getting to Know Python\u2019s del Statement\n Python\u2019s del statement allows you to remove references to objects from a given namespace or container type. It performs an operation that\u2019s the opposite of what an assignment statement does. It\u2019s sort of an unassignment statement that allows you to unbind one or more names from their referenced objects.This is a natural feature to have in Python. If you can create a variable by writing variable = value, then you must have the option to undo this operation by deleting variable. That\u2019s where del comes on the scene.The del statement can come in handy in different coding situations, such as:Of course, this list is incomplete. You may find some other appropriate use cases for this statement. In this tutorial, you\u2019ll learn how the del statement works and how to use it in your code. To kick things off, you\u2019ll start by learning the general syntax of del in Python.A Python del statement consists of the del keyword, followed by a comma-separated series of references.Note: In this tutorial, you\u2019ll use the term reference to generically designate names or identifiers that can hold references to objects in Python.Here\u2019s the general syntax of the del statement in Python:The del statement allows you to remove one or more references from a given namespace. It also lets you delete data from mutable container types, such as lists and dictionaries.You\u2019ll often use this statement with a single argument. However, it also supports a series of arguments separated by commas.In the above construct, reference_* represents any kind of identifier that can hold references to concrete objects stored in memory. In practice, these references can include:You can use any of these references as arguments to del. If you use a comma-separated series of arguments, then keep in mind that del operates on every argument sequentially from left to right. This behavior can be risky when you\u2019re removing items from lists, as you\u2019ll learn later in this tutorial.Here\u2019s a quick example of using del to remove a variable:Once you\u2019ve run the del statement, the variable greeting is no longer available. If you try to access greeting, then you get a NameError because that variable doesn\u2019t exist anymore.Removing reference holders like variables is the primary goal of del. This statement doesn\u2019t remove objects. In the following section, you\u2019ll dive deeper into the actual and immediate effects of running a del statement.Unlock This Article\nAlready a member?

To implement this, you need a comprehensive word list.Create a topical Wordle clone: The word list that you\u2019ve downloaded in this tutorial is based on the words in the tutorial itself. It might be more interesting to create a word list based on a theme that interests you. Maybe you can create a list of programming terms, people\u2019s names, or Shakespearean plays.Add a splash screen: A splash\u2014or intro\u2014screen is a nice way to prepare your user for what they\u2019re in for. To make your application easier to use, you can also add some in-game instructions\u2014for example, to explain the aim of the game and what the different colors represent.Have fun exploring your own Wordle variants.

By further developing this app, you can build your knowledge and consolidate your skills while creating an attractive addition to your programming portfolio. Here are a few suggestions for what you might do next:Style the application: The to-do list application\u2019s user interface (UI) is unapologetically bland and unadorned. Simple.css has helped you to create an acceptable UI, but nothing more than that. You might want to investigate some ways to improve it:The Simple.css website has links to several sites that have built on the base CSS from Simple.css to produce something more attractive.There are many other free CSS libraries out there! For instance, you could investigate Bootstrap, Semantic UI, or Font Awesome.You can also use raw CSS. CSS is an extremely powerful styling tool, and if you\u2019re willing to invest the time to learn its ins and outs, there\u2019s no limit to what you can make it do.Enhance the application: There are plenty of useful features that you could add to this application. One obvious improvement would be to handle task completion and deadlines. You could add a completed field to the to-do items so that your users can distinguish between completed tasks and those that still need action. You could even add logic to send email reminders if they miss due dates.Make it multi-user: If you find a to-do list manager useful, then a logical step might be to extend it to multiple users, such as members of your team. Each user could have their own space with their individual to-do lists, and you could consider implementing shared lists to enable cooperative planning. In this case, you should explore some of Django\u2019s security options, as well as learning about a multi-user database like MySQL or Postgres.Explore more class-based views:\nIn this project, you\u2019ve made use of several of Django\u2019s generic class-based views. But Django has a rich architecture of class-based views and mixins to enable maximum code reuse, and you\u2019ve hardly scratched the surface here. You can read much more about your options in the official Django documentation on class-based views.Build your expertise with more Django projects: Real Python has many Django project tutorials at different levels.

    "description": "Let's look at using Python and Pandas to perform data analysis on obesity in England.",
    "text": "But what about the future?\n The graph still doesn\u2019t tell us what will happen to children\u2019s obesity in the future. There are ways to extrapolate graphs like these into the future, but I must give a warning before we proceed: The obesity data has no underlying mathematical foundation. That is, we can\u2019t find a formula that will predict how these values will change in the future. Everything is essentially guesswork. With this warning in mind, let\u2019s see how we can try to extrapolate our graph.First, Scipy does provide a function for extrapolation, but it only works for monotically increasing data (while our data goes up and down).We can try curve fitting:We\u2019ll use these two functions together to try and predict the future for England\u2019s children:Here, we extract the values for children under 16. For the x axis, the original graph had dates. To simplify our graph, we\u2019ll just be using the the numbers 0-10.Output:One more thing: Curve fitting uses different degrees of polynomials. In very simple terms,the higher the degree, the more accurate the curve fitting will be, but there is also the chance that the results will be garbage. Scipy will sometimes warn you if the degree is too high. Don\u2019t worry, this will be more clear when we look at some examples.We set the polynomial degree to 3. We then use the Numpy polyfit() function to try to fit a graph through the data we have. The poly1d() function is then called on the equation we generated to create a function that will be used to generate our values. This returns a function called poly_interp that we will use below:We loop from 0 to 10, and call the poly_interp() function on each value. Remember, this is the function we generated when we ran the curve fitting algorithm.Before moving on, let\u2019s see what the different polynomial degrees mean.We will plot both the original data, and our own data, to see how close our equation reached the ideal data:The original data will be plotted in blue and labelled Orig, while the generated data will be red and labelled Fitted.With a polynomial value of 3:We see it isn\u2019t that good a fit, so let\u2019s try 5:Much better. What about 7?Now we get an almost perfect match. So, why wouldn\u2019t we always use higher values?Because the higher values have been so tightly coupled to this graph, they make prediction useless. If we try to extrapolate from the graph above, we get garbage values. Trying different values, I found that polynomial degrees of 3 and 4 were the only ones that give accurate results, so that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be using.We are going to re-run our poly_interp() function, this time for values from 0-15, to predict five years into the future.This is the same code as before. Let\u2019s again see the results with polynomial degrees of 3 and 4. The new extrapolated line is the green one and shows our prediction.With 3:Here, the obesity is going down. How about 4?But here, it is shooting up, so kids will end up weighing like tractors!Which of the two graphs is correct? It depends on whether you are working for the government or the opposition.This is actually a feature, not bug. You must have heard these political debates where two sides draw the exact opposite conclusions from the same data? Now you see how it\u2019s possible to draw radically different conclusions by tweaking small parameters.And that is the reason we must be careful when accepting figures and graphs from lobbyists, especially if they are not willing to share the raw data. Sometimes, predictions are better left to astrologers.Cheers!",

Most developers engaged in TDD don\u2019t always adhere to it in every single situation. There are times that you must deviate from it in order to just get things done - which is perfectly fine. If you\u2019d like to refactor some of the code/process to fully adhere to the TDD process, you can. In fact, it may be a good practice.Second, think about the tests I missed. Determining what and when to test is difficult. It takes time and much practice to get good at testing in general. I\u2019ve left many blanks that I intend to revel in my next post. See if you can find those and add tests.Finally, remember the last step in the TDD process? Refactoring. This step is vital as it helps create readable, maintainable code that you not only understand now - but in the future as well. When you look back at your code, think about tests you can combine. Also, which tests should you add to ensure that all written code is tested? You could test for null values and/or server side authentication, for example. You should refactor your code before moving on to writing any new code - which I did not do for time\u2019s sake. Perhaps another blog post?

Fortunately, there are a lot of good resources - like here and here.Textures can make a big difference, which is why I love Subtle Patterns. Update the body class with the following code.

We will explore more best practices for writing templates, keeping our models and forms in sync, and handling static files.In Part III we\u2019ll explore writing tests for our application, logging, and debugging errors.In Part IV we\u2019ll do some Test Driven Development to enable our application to accept payments and display simple reports.In Part V we will write a RESTful JSON API for others to consume.In Part VI we will cover automating deployments (on Heroku) with Fabric and basic A/B Feature Testing.Finally, in Part VII we will cover preserving your application for the future with documentation, code coverage and quality metric tools.Thanks for reading and tune in next time!",

    "text": "Next Steps\n From this point, it is as easy as adding new @route-decorated functions to create new pages.Creating the HTML is simple: In the above app, we just inlined the HTML in the file itself. It\u2019s easy to modify this to load the template from a file. For example:This will load the template file main_template.tpl, which must be placed in a views folder within your project structure, and render it to the end user.Refer to the bottle documentation for more info.We\u2019ll look at how to add additional pages and templates in subsequent posts. However, I urge you to try this on your own. Post any questions as comments below.Check out Part 2!",
